AKISMET_API_KEY = 'akismet key here'
BLOG_TITLE = "Your Blog's Title Here"

BLOG_AUTHOR = "Your Name Here"
BLOG_AUTHOR_EMAIL = "you@example.com"
BLOG_COPYRIGHT = "Copyright (c) 2008, " + BLOG_AUTHOR

head
    -- This is stuff in the <head></head> area
subtitle
    -- This is the local page title/name.
content
    -- Content!
